# Collatz-Conjecture

The Collatz Conjecture is a naturally occurring mathematical sequence.  
Given an integer input `x`, 1 of 2 rules is applied:

+ If `x` is odd: `x = 3x+1`
+ If `x` even: `x = x/2`

And continues until `x = 1` is reached.

This repository will return a list of the hailstone numbers associated with Collatz Conjecture and visualize the results on a 2D plot. For more information, see [here](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/CollatzProblem.html).
